A place for me to log stuff about the C++ 17 changes.

# New Stuff

## Structured Binding

```cpp
{a,b} =
```

## Automatic type deduction for constructors 
Instead of the extremely painful and totally unnecessary (in C++17) ...

```cpp
std::lock_guard<std::recursive_mutex> lock(mutex);
```

... we can now write ...

```cpp
std::lock_guard lock(mutex);
```

... phew ... more crud can be deleted.

## std::byte
## std::variant<>
## std::optional<>
## std::any
## std::string_view

# Changed Stuff
# Deprecated Stuff
