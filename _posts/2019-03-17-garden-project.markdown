Not a coding blog this time ... this is one of the things I do when I'm not at the keyboard coding. Well I say I do ... I've been living here for seven years now.

When I first moved in there were some apple trees strewn across the garden dividing it into two areas ... one publicly hideous ... the other a secret garden of hideousness.

I began taming it by getting the trees removed ... and then letting it grow into a jungle ... not a good plan ... but work beckoned and the garden would live to fight back at me another day.

This blog will be on going ... but it'll probably remain on this date as that is when I started recording my progress in this repository ... although work started a while back and will continue into the future.
