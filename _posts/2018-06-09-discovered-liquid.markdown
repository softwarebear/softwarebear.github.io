I have been looking around for something that is a bit more flexible than blogger and wordpress ... After a bit of consultation with my friends over at [#include <C++>](http://www.includecpp.org){:target="_blank"} I decided to investigate [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} which uses [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}
 to provide a framework for our masterpieces and powers the local development and final delivery of the pages once published to your default GitHub repo blog.

I chose the [Midnight theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/midnight){:target="_blank"} as it is clean and the text is very reable ... However it didn't come with a blog by default so I did a bit of googling and found the [Jekyll documentation on posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#displaying-an-index-of-posts){:target="_blank"}

So I have a blog now ... and have gone back and added my other blog posts on here from other sites ... have published the site all together and directed people to it. So any posts prior in time to now are from old sites ... any after now until a new technology comes along are on this site.
