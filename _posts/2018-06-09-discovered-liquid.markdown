It has taken a little bit of googling to find out how to add posts to my lovely themed jekyll site that didn't include a blog ... but I figured it out with the help of [Jekyll documentation on posts][jekyll-posts]

So I have a blog now ... and I can go back and add my other blog posts on here from other sites ... then I can publish the site all together and direct people to it. So any posts prior in time to now are from old sites ... any after now until a new technology comes along are on this site.
